# [Go Bag](https://rebekahheacock.github.io/go-bag/)

Packing lists for frequent travelers.

## About Go Bag

[Go Bag](https://rebekahheacock.github.io/go-bag/) lets frequent travelers say goodbye to hastily scribbled packing lists. Go Bag saves your packing lists—whether they're for once-in-a-lifetime adventures or monthly business trips—and lets you add and delete items, search through a database of common travel necessities, check off items as you pack for an upcoming trip, and clone, edit, and delete lists depending on your travel schedule.

Go Bag depends on a Rails API, which is at [rebekahheacock/go-bag-api](https://github.com/rebekahheacock/go-bag-api). The API handles user authentication and the saving and storage of packing list and item data.

## Project Planning

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to create an account so I can save lists.
- As a user, I want to create a new list for each trip.
- As a user, I want to be able to clone a list so I don't have to start from scratch for a similar trip.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit a list so I can make changes as my plans change.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all of my lists so I can easily review them.
- As a user, I want to be able to check items off my list so I can track whether I've packed them.
